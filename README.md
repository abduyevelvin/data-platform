# Data Platform

This repository contains the core components for the Data Platform:

- **drive**: The server-side service for managing and storing drive data.
- **drive-client**: The client application for interacting with the drive service.

## Getting Started

To use a specific service:

1. Navigate to the desired folder (`drive` or `drive-client`).
2. Follow the instructions in the corresponding `README.md` to build, run, or deploy the service.

Each service is maintained in its directory. To use the client (drive-client), ensure the server (drive) is running, as the client depends on the server to provide data and functionality.
Refer to the individual service documentation for setup and usage details.
